# Flutter Auth

This authentication module was created by me for a university group projectâ€”a medicine delivery mobile app. It demonstrates Firebase Auth integration for user sign up, sign in, and sign out. This project is suitable for learning and as a starter template for authentication-based Flutter apps.

## Features

- Email & password sign up
- Email & password sign in
- Firebase authentication integration
- Simple UI for authentication

## Getting Started

3. Configure Firebase:
